#Flosi - a photo sharing ionic app

I am currently learning Ionic and Angular as well as JS

to install and run the app 

```javascript
$ sudo npm install -g cordova
$ sudo npm install -g ionic
```

make sure you are inside the folder named flosi then

```javascript
$ ionic serve
```

the app also requires this plugin: $ cordova plugin add org.apache.cordova.camera
